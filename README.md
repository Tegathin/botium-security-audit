# üß© Botium Toys Security Audit

This project is part of my cybersecurity portfolio, completed during my training in the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. It simulates a real-world security audit for a fictional company, **Botium Toys**, focused on identifying risks and recommending improvements across technical, administrative, and physical security domains.
